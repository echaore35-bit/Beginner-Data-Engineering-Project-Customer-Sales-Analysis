# Beginner-Data-Engineering-Project-Customer-Sales-Analysis
This project demonstrates foundational data engineering and SQL analytics skills using two datasets: customers.csv and sales_transactions.csv. It focuses on cleaning data, building a relational schema, joining tables, performing aggregations, using window functions, and segmenting customers by spending behavior.

# Project Overview

This project mimics a real-world retail analytics scenario. A business wants to understand:

- Who their most valuable customers are

- How often customers purchase and how much they spend

- Which products generate the highest revenue

- Revenue performance trends over time

By using SQL queries and data modeling techniques, we generate insights that can support marketing, retention, and sales strategy decisions.
